I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href='https://search.epfl.ch/?filter=unit&q=SMILS'>Lab for Statistical Mechanics of Inference in Large Systems (SMILS)</a> at the <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/en/'>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a> in Switzerland. My research focus is on intersection between machine learning and statistical mechanics.
