Together with my colleague Anastasia Remizova, I will be presenting our work [Stochastic Gradient Flow Dynamics of Test Risk and its Exact Solution for Weak Features](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/veiga24a.html) on the Poster Session 1 at ICML, Hall C 4-9, from 11:30 am to 1 pm (CEST). We will be next to poster #1901. Come and have a chat with us!
