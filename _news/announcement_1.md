Diffusion models have become state-of-the-art in the generative modelling of images. In collaboration with Anand Jerry George and Nicolas Macris, we study theoretical aspects of these models in our two new preprints. In [Denoising Score Matching with Random Features: Insights on Diffusion Models from Precise Learning Curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00336), we analyse the time-reversed dynamics of denoising score matching in generative diffusion models. In [Analysis of Diffusion Models for Manifold Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04339), we study the effects of manifold data under the assumption of exact empirical score. Check it out!
