Understanding the role of stochasticity in gradient-based learning dynamics and in achieving different global minima and how it is related to good generalization performances is of most importance. In our new preprint, [Stochastic Gradient Flow Dynamics of Test Risk and its Exact Solution for Weak Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07626), in collaboration with Anastasia Remizova and Nicolas Macris, we construct a path-integral framework to compute the difference between pure gradient flow and stochastic gradient flow trajectories in the limit of small learning rate. Check it out!
